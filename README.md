# big-data-challenge

We have two levels under the folder:
level-1: Two data sets: Automotive and Software were used for analysis. big_data1.ipynb was using the 
Automotive data set for analysis and big_data2.ipynb used the SOftware data set. The software dataset was a 
lot smaller than Automotive data set. 

Level-2: We used the software data set to dig more into whether the reviews were fair and unbiased. We didnt complete 
the complete investigation but initial review seemed to indicte that ratings that didnt have verified purchase set to TRUE slightly 
biased the ratings towards positive feedback by 1% on average. 

PPT file is also included

We could have picked another data set like Music dataset and compared the Amazon music vs non amazon music and identified some bias.
